			<h4>Introduction</h4>
			<p>Millions of users come on Twitch to watch their favorite streamers play games. Pika is a tool for Twitch users to interact with others by using the streamers screen as a playground for expressing themselves. 
			</p>
			<h4>Challenge</h4> 
			<p>Success for streamers on Twitch rely on the amount of viewers they have. In order to grow their number of viewers, streamers need to entertain them not only by playing games, but also interacting with them. The main source of interaction is through Twitch chat, once that becomes crowded, streamers have a hard time following the discussions. Our goal was to fix the interaction system between streamers and their audiences.</p>
			<h4>My Role</h4> 
			<p id="bullet">Worked as a Product designer, alongside two additional designers, two product managers, and a team of engineers. Highlights include:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Collaborated and brainstormed with the team to come up with ideas</li>
				<li>Researched and observed users to understand their needs and requirements</li>
				<li>Designed low and high fidelity websites</li>
				<li>Created prototypes for testing and presenting to stakeholders</li>
				<li>Animation through After Effects for intuitive interaction design</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Discovery</h3>
			<h4>Initial expression</h4> 
			<p>With the amount of people commenting on Twitch, chatrooms were practically useless when trying to hold a conversation. The result causes people to spam emojis and expressions instead. This helps the streamer, who could be occupied playing their game, to understand how their audience is doing at a glance.</p>

			<h3>Research</h3>
			<h4>Interviews</h4>
			<p>Our focus was on Taiwan Twitch streams, so we went ahead an interviewed streamers from Taiwan. What we wanted to find out was who these people were, and why they use their time to watch others play games.</p>
			<div class="dustimgs"><img class="shadow" src="interviewimg.png"></div>
			<h4>Personas</h4>
			<p>Once we collected enough data from interviews, we created personas to reflect a typical Twitch profile. This persona helped us understand who these users were, why they watched streams, and what they hope to get out of it.</p>
			<div class="dustimgs"><img class="shadow" src="persona.png"></div>
			<h4>Wireframes</h4>
			<p>Once we had an idea of who are users were, our team sat down to dicuss the options. We created multiple wireframes to help us see what would and wouldn't work. We decided to create a mobile app that users could send emojis from their phone to the screen.</p>
			<div class="wireframeimg"><img class="img2" src="pikawireframe.png"></div>
			<h3>Design</h3>
			<h4>MVP</h4>
			<p>Our deadline was short, so we needed to come up with a minimum viable product that was enough to get users signing up as well as getting feedback. The important features needed to work were an onboarding process, homepage with stickers, and a QR scanner.</p>
			<div class="dustimgs" id="mobileflow"><img src="mobileflow.png"></div>
			<p>Users would connect by scanning a QR code displayed on a participating stream. Once connected, users can see their stickers displayed on screen by selecting them in the app.</p>

			<h1>Pika v2</h1>
			<p>Although the on-screen stickers were received positively, usage rate for the app declined. People preferred using the chatroom since it was easier to access. We decided to ditch the app entirely, and move the product straight onto the Twitch chat.</p>
			<h4>Investigating</h4>
			<p>During our research, we found streams spammed with numbers or letters, which were common ways to express a saying or emotion. For example, spamming 6 or 7 meant good job, but spamming 87 meant that the streamer was doing terrible.</p>
			<div style="width:100%;height:0px;position:relative;padding-bottom:50.977%;"><iframe src="https://streamable.com/s/3myhc/pmkxma?autoplay=1&muted=1" frameborder="0" width="100%" height="100%" style="width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;left:0px;top:0px;overflow:hidden;"></iframe></div>
			<h3>Design</h3>
			<h4>Localizing Stickers</h4>
			<p>We collected and gathered the most commonly used expressions, and designated certain stickers to them. To send these stickers on-screen, users typed "!" in front of the numbers or letters. We also created game specific stickers for the more popular games.</p>
			<div class="dustimgs"><img class="img4" src="numberemotions.png"></div>
			<h4>Reassessing</h4>
			<p>Stickers would pop up in a designated area, but we quickly learned that streamers and viewers weren't fond of their stream being partially blocked. Our solution was to make the stickers move across the screen as they fade out instead. This benefited us because moving stickers grabbed more attention, as well as solved the problem of not blocking an area of the screen.</p>
			<div class="streamable" style="width:100%;height:0px;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.250%;"><iframe src="https://streamable.com/s/qowtf/abopqe?autoplay=1&muted=1" frameborder="0" width="100%" height="100%" style="width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;left:0px;top:0px;overflow:hidden;"></iframe>
			</div>
			<h4>Increasing Engagement</h4>
			<p id="bullet">Pika usage relied on the events happening within the stream. If nothing exciting was happening, Pika wasn't being used. We brainstormed ideas for games that users can play with during downtime. Some contraints we had to work with:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Users interacted through the chat.</li>
				<li>Instructions would need to be displayed on screen.</li>
				<li>The game cannot obstruct more than 1/3 of the screen.</li>
				<li>Game has to be visible through a moving background.</li>
				<li>Game needed to be short as to not cover the screen for too long.</li>
			</ul>
			<div class="dustimgs" id="turtlepadding"><img src="turtlerace.png"></div>
			<p>We came up with a turtle race where users typed commands displayed on screen to get the turtle moving. The first turtle across the line won, and the user who sent the most commands displayed on screen.</p>
			<h4>Website</h4>
			<p>We wanted to give users a purpose for sending stickers, so we decided to create a website. Users with accounts could customize their sticker commands, see statistics on various things, and also the ability to level up.</p>

		<div class="dustbody">
			<h4>Launch</h4>
			<p>By reducing the amount of steps needed to send stickers, we were able to increase engagement. Turtle race was also a big hit, we saw streamers postponing what they were doing to participate.</p>

			<iframe class="youtubevideo" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/auhLD_2fIOI" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
			<h4>What we Learned</h4>
			<p>Sticker commands were increasing steadily. People liked the added sticker animation when sending messages. As for the Turtle race, it eventually died down. Without the "new" factor, the game became repetitive with nothing to show for. Going back to the drawing board, the team brainstormed ideas to see what we could improve.</p>

			<h1>Pika War</h1>
			<h4>Goal</h4>
			<p>We shifted our focus onto the streamers. We noticed whenever a streamer asked their viewers to send stickers, viewer participation went through the roof. If we found a way to get streamers more involved with Pika, engagement would also increase.</p>
			<h4>Research</h4>
			<p>What we wanted to figure out was how and when a streamers would engage in conversation with their viewers. Additional interviews helped us confirm that most streamers didn't have a big enough following to get paid. Without enough views, subscriptions, etc. it would be difficult to maintain streaming for long.</p>  
			<div class="centerimg">
			<img class="userinterview" src="userinterview.png">
			</div>
			<h3>Design</h3>
			<h4>Website</h4>
			<p>Pika War was a bi-weekly competition for streamers to go up against one another. Streamers would be ranked by points, and at the end of the war, the top streamers would receive reward money.</p>

	</div>

	<div class="dustimgs" id="warflow"><img src="pikawarflow.png"></div>

	<div id="bodythree">
		<div class="dustbody">
			<p>First, we expanded the viewer profile with the ability to purchase new stickers we made. A new feature of unlocking stickers incentivized users to participate more, as well as potentially spending money to unlock them. Users were also able to view a leaderboard, that showed the ranking and statistics of streamers.</p>
			<div class="giffull">
			<img class="leaderboardgif" src="leaderboard.gif">
			</div>
			<h4>Minigames</h4>
			<p>The point system was in place, but now we needed to come up with ways for users to earn points aside from sending stickers. We took the turtle race and expanded it across Twitch streams. Instead of viewers vs viewers, it became streamer vs streamer. To earn points, streamers had to beat the best time set by other streamers.</p>
			<div class="streamable" style="width:100%;height:0px;position:relative;padding-bottom:27.522%;"><iframe src="https://streamable.com/s/0wy72/kprvme?autoplay=1&muted=1" frameborder="0" width="100%" height="100%" style="width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;left:0px;top:0px;overflow:hidden;"></iframe>
			</div>
			<p>A complication we faced was how to make Pika War fair. Streamers with larger audiences could generate points easier. With that in mind, we came up with the snake game. The snake moved one block per command, and the game restarted if it hit a wall. This was difficult for larger audiences to accomplish, but easier for smaller audiences.</p>

			<h3>Release</h3>
			<p>A huge amount of Taiwanese streamers participated in Pika War. There were around 170 streamers in the first Pika War event. Getting streamers involved created a ton of participation from their viewers. The first Pika War increased engagement by 300%.</p>
