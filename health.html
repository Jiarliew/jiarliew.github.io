			<h3>ECG Interface (Design Challenge)</h3>
			<p>Design a consumer mobile app that displays ECG readings. Provide a high-level flow with supporting wireframes, as well as a high-fidelity mock for at least one step of this experience.</p>	
			<h4>Research</h4>
			<p>I started my process by learning more about ECG and getting a better understanding of who the users were. After gathering initials thoughts, I jotted down assumptions and questions that I needed answered. 
			</p>
			<div class="dustimgs" id="shadow"><img class="surveyimg" src="healthone.png"></div>
			<p>I looked at existing products in the market to get an idea of a typical user experience. As I went through an app, I wrote down things I liked and disliked, from the onboarding process to the feature usability. I also took a look at the app reviews as a way to get quantitative data.</p>
			<div class="dustimgs"><img class="surveyimg" src="healthtwo.png"></div>
			<p>One notable feature was the ability to take a reading prior to signing up. It was a great way to get results faster, as well as educate potential users. Once a user is invested, they would be more inclined to sign up.
			<br><br>
			Another interesting discovery was the different devices used to get an ECG reading. Most apps used the phone's camera and flash since it was free. Other apps, such as Kardia, had created their own device that was purchased separately. Both options had their advantages. Using an external device can get a better reading, but a phone is always on you.</p>
			<h4>Interviews</h4>
			<p>I interviewed friends and family who have used an ECG monitor, as well as those who have not. When conducting interviews, my goal was to figure out existing pain points that I could help solve. I also wanted to know what people thought about when using an app as a diagnosis/analysis for their health. Aside from asking questions, I observed them using existing apps to discover any difficulties they were having.</p>
			<h4>Personas</h4>
			<p>After I had a better understanding of the users and the product, I created personas to help remind me about what the goals and needs were as I continued the process.</p>
			<div class="dustimgs"><img class="companal" src="healththree.png"></div>
			<h4>Solving the Problem</h4>
			<p>The overall goal was to get people to be proactive about their health. When interviewing people, everyone agreed that health was important. My follow-up question was why they weren't as proactive as they liked to be. Their response was that it cost time and resources to monitoring their health. When shown different apps, a common question people asked was if the app works accurately. The problem stemmed from people not trusting that an app can do what doctors and/or a professional medical device could do. I set out to create an app that people can trust by educating them, and making health monitoring easily accessible.
			</p>
			<h4>Wireframe</h4>
			<p>With all the features written down, I sketched a couple user flows and stories to get an idea of the screens I needed. Once I had the screens mapped out, I created wireframes so I can visualize it in more detail.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="dustbody">
			<p>Onboarding only required email and password, all other information was optional. On the home screen, users can click the profile button to input any information not given during onboarding, including their doctor's information. I will go more into detail on two flows of the app, onboarding and receiving an ECG reading.</p>
			<h4>Onboarding Flow</h4>
		</div>

			<div class="dustimgs" id="fivepadding"><img class="img4" src="healthfive.png"></div>

		<div class="dustbody">
			<p>The welcome screen consists of a sign up button, login button, and a sliding carousel. The carousel is a great way to educate users on what an ECG is. At the end of the carousel, users would have the option to get an ECG reading before they decide to sign up. The reason for this is to get users trying the app as soon as possible. As a health app, the more information we know about someone, the more accurate the readings can be. A lot of times, users leave because the onboarding process required too much information. By letting users try the apps feature, we get the opportunity to impress them.</p>
			<h4>ECG Reading Flow</h4>
		</div>

			<div class="dustimgs" id="fivepadding"><img class="img3" src="healthsix.png"></div>

		<div class="dustbody">
			<p>Getting an ECG reading is the main feature of the app. The scan button should be the first thing people see when opening the app. Prior to scanning, an informations page is shown where users can select different options to scan, as well as instructions on how to get a reading. An important feature added was the ability to save audio recordings. It was common for doctors to ask patients to describe how painful certain events were, but for many, it was hard to describe accurately something that happened weeks or months ago. The audio recording feature gave people the ability to recall feelings as they happen.</p> 
			<div class="dustimgs"><img class="img4" src="healthseven.png"></div>
			<p>One problem I saw when people scanned their fingers was the ability to hold still. Holding their hand up and completely still for a period of time wasn't easy. At the same time, when users were looking at the graph, slight movement of their hand would alter the reading, causing people to question if it scanned accurately. </p> 
			<div class="dustimgs"><img class="img4" src="healtheight.png"></div>
			<p>This pain point was easily resolved by instructioning the user to place the phone screen flat on a surface. In this position, a user can rest their hand in a comfortable position, making it easier to not move. This also resolved the issue of users making premature doubts about the reading as they aren't able to look at the screen. Once the flash is turned off, the scan is complete. </p>
			<h4>High Fidelity Mocks</h4>
			<div class="dustimgs" id="fivepadding"><img class="img4" src="healthnine.png"></div>
			<p>Scan button is given significant amount of space and a bold color to help grab the user's attention. The next important information we want to give is their analysis. A weekly analysis is shown below the scan button. Below the weekly graph are individual cards showing daily scan results. As a user taps a card, they are able to view more information.</p>
			<div class="dustimgs" id="fivepadding"><img src="healtheleven.gif"></div>
			<p>On the scanning page, the heart animates to show that it is currently in the scanning phase, prompting users to take action. Detailed instructions as well as an illustration is shown to help get an accurate reading.</p>
			<div class="dustimgs" id="fivepadding"><img src="healthtwelve.png"></div>
			<p>When the results are in, the flash turns off and the results page appears. We want users to focus on the average bpm and the ECG reading, so we let those take up a majority of the screen. Users have a variety of actions they can take from here. They can document information by either writing down notes or save an audio recording. For those who want immediate help, they can send the results to their doctor straight from the app. Selecting the question mark button brings up help and a way to educate people on reading an ECG. Most importantly, people can save their daily reading for documentation and future analysis.</p>
			<h4>Conclusion</h4>
			<p>Next steps would be creating prototypes and testing with users. From there we would fix problems that come up, and continue testing until we get the results we are satisfied with.</p>
