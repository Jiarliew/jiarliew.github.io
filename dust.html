			<h2>Problem</h2>
			<p>The task was to redesign the existing app. The first step was to receive feedback of the app from current users to see how they feel about the app.</p>
			<h2>Step One: Discovery</h2>
			<h4>Survey</h4> 
			<p>Results from users showed that the UI was a glaring problem. The UI was confusing from the navigation down to the color.</p>
			<h4>Initial User Testing</h4>
			<p>Viewing the users interact with the app provided better insight to the problems they faced.</p>
			<div class="dustimgs"><img class="img1" src="image1.png"></div>
			<p>Major pain points included a confusing navigation, unclear terminology, ambiguous icons, and lack of hierarchy.Users had a hard time finding and understanding the important features because of this. This ultimately led to users being frustrated and leaving the app.</p>
			<h4>Prioritizing</h4>
			<p>Along with the major pain points, there were many small problems that were discovered from user testing. Prioritizing would help focus on the bigger issues when designing, and also help keep in mind the smaller issues for the future.</p>
			<div class="dustimgs"><img class="img2" src="image2.png"></div>
			<h2>Step Two: Discovery</h2>
			<h4>Navigation</h4>
			<p>The first major change was to create a more centralized navigation. Users were confused with the existing app that had two bottom buttons and three top tabs that leaded to different screens. We tested various iterations to find the one with the least pain points according to the users.</p>
			<div><img src="c"></div>
			<p>A bottom navigation deemed most effective. Creating a five tab navigation, with the most used/important features for users. Combining the existing profile button into the navigation, and adding a contacts tab.</p>
			<h4>Naming Convention</h4>
			<p>Users were still struggling to understand what certain tabs did because of the branded terminology and the ambiguous icons that were used, that led to users having to tap around to fully understand. Creating more conventional text and icons was the next problem to solve.
			</p>
			<div class="dustimgs"><img class="img4" src="image4.png"></div>
			<p>The main tabs that were confusing to users were the 'dust' and 'blast' screen. The terminology was marketed with the app name in mind, but made no sense to new users. We questioned users with various tab names to see what users would make of it. It was quickly discovered that the simpler terms were easier to undertsand.</p>
			<div><img src="e"></div>
			<h4>Color</h4>
			<p>Something had to be done with the existing color palette. Multiple colors placed all over the app created no sense of hierarchy.</p>
			<div class="dustimgs"><img class="img6" src="image6.png"></div>
			<p>To simplify the app, using one color would help place emphasis on the important items that would help guide the user. The apps main feature was security, and users needed to trust using the app. Blue was the perfect color. After testing the various colors, almost all users associated the app to Facebook instantly. This led to trying out other colors. Orange was a color that conveys security, which was something the app needs users to believe.</p>

			<h2>Home Stretch</h2>
			<p>After knocking down the larger problems, there was still work to be done. Smaller issues still plays a large part in creating a good app. Efficiently using whitepace and font weight helped to create hierarchy. Guiding users around the app with informative empty screens, and also simplifying the onboarding process. After many iterations and testing, the redesign was complete. User testing was a fantastic way to discover the problems users faced with the app.</p>
