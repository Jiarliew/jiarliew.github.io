			<h2>Redesigning Dust</h2>
			<p>Over the years of adding features, the app eventually became bloated with stuff, making it feel cluttered with no correlation or visual hierarchy. As a result, users were getting confused and lost, ultimately leading to them leaving with a bad taste of the app. The task to completely redesign from the ground up, was a challenge, but a much needed one. Throwing away old habits, the new app would be of designing with centered based on our users.</p>
			<h2>Step One: Discovery</h2>
			<h4>Survey</h4> 
			<p>Surveys were sent out to users to ask what they liked and disliked about the app. After gathering and reading all the responses, results showed that the UI was a glaring problem. It was confusing all around, from the navigation down to the uncordinated colors.</p>
			<h4>Initial User Testing</h4>
			<p>Viewing users interact with the app provided amazing insight to additional problems that we never would have gathered from surveys alone. The amount of problems in the end were astonishing, and we really had a lot of work to do.</p>
			<div class="dustimgs"><img class="img1" src="image1.png"></div>
			<!--<p class="imgdescription">Pain points discovered from user test and surveying.</p>-->
			<p>Major pain points included a confusing navigation, unclear terminology, ambiguous icons, lack of hierarchy, and the list goes on. These issues caused our users to have a difficult time navigating the app. Which ultimately led to users being frustrated and leaving the app.</p>
			<h4>Prioritizing</h4>
			<p>When creating a list of major pain points, small problems were also discovered. Even after the major problems were fixed, we knew that the amount of small problems could cause users to run away. Prioritizing pain points helped the design team focus on the bigger issues when designing, while keeping the smaller problems in mind for later.</p>
			<div class="dustimgs"><img class="img2" src="image2.png"></div>
			<h4>Competitive Analysis</h4>
			<p>A great way to know what features are important or not was to create a competitive anaylsis. By looking at similar apps, we could establish a baseline for the features that users of those apps were missing out on. By creating an app that includes all the features that users are hoping for, will help retainment.</p>

			<!--<p class="imgdescription">Prioritizing pain points from high to low.</p>-->
			<h2>Step Two: Designing</h2>
			<h4>Navigation</h4>
			<p>The first major change was to create a centralized navigation. Users were confused with the existing app that had two bottom buttons and three top tabs. We tested various design iterations to find the one with the least pain points according to the users. In the end, a bottom navigation was the most effective. Condensing only the most important tabs to the navigation, users were able to navigate much more seamlessly.</p>

			<!--<p class="imgdescription">User testing different navigation styles.</p>-->
			<h4>Naming Convention</h4>
			<p>Although users were starting to understand our app a lot faster, there was still room for improvement. Users were still struggling to understand what certain tabs meant. The icons were too ambiguous with the names being terminology we made up, names such as "dust" and "blast". This led to users having to tap around the navigation a couple times to fully understand. Creating conventional names and icons was the next problem to solve. We questioned users with various tab names to see what users would make of it. It was quickly discovered that the simpler terms were easier to understand.</p>

			<!--<p class="imgdescription">Users had a hard time understanding where tabs lead to with the current naming conventions</p>-->
			<!--<div class="dustimgs"><img class="img5" src="image5.png"></div>-->
			<h4>Colors</h4>
			<p>Multiple colors schemes made the app look inconsistent, and also confused users at time for what was clickable. Using one color would help place unify the app, while being able to put emphasis on the important items that would help guide the user. The apps main feature was to give users a sense of trust and security. Blue conveys both of those senses, so we tested multiple shades. After testing though, we realized that almost all users associated the app to Facebook instantly.</p>
			<div class="dustimgs"><img class="img6" src="image6.png"></div>
			<!--<p class="imgdescription">The color blue conveys trust.</p>-->
			<p>We didn't want new users to associate our app with another, so we decided to not use blue. This led to trying out other colors such as orange. Orange was another color that portrayed security, which was something the app needs users to believe.</p>
			<div class="dustimgs"><img class="img7" src="image7.png"></div>
			<!--<p class="imgdescription">Because blue was too associated with Facebook, orange was another color that conveyed a sense of security.</p>-->
			<h4>Hierarchy</h4>
			<p>To keep things consistent at the moment and in the future, creating a color palette was needed so we wouldn't accidently use too many shades of orange. Another way we created hierarchy was to ke</p>
			<h2>Outcome</h2>
			<p>After knocking out the larger problems, there was still a lot of work to be done. Smaller issues still played a large part in creating a great app. Efficiently using whitepace and font weight helped to create hierarchy. Creating informative empty screens helped to guide users around the app. Simplifying the onboarding process generated more accounts created.</p>

		<p id="last">After many iterations and testing all over the app, the redesign was complete. There were many changes to the app, from onboarding, to icons, to colors, and even completely changing the name and logo. Without user testing, we never could've spotted or corrected many of the existing problems. Utilizing user test was a fantastic way to help improve our app.</p>
