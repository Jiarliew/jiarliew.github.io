			<h4>Introduction</h4>
			<p>Dust is a messaging app that keeps messages anonymous and secure, so no one has a record of what you say. Send messages that can be deleted on all devices, and never worry about your messages being traced back to you.
			</p>
			<h4>Challenge</h4> 
			<p>There was a good amount of new users coming to try the app due to publicity from Mark Cuban, but there was little interest for people to use it. Our team was tasked to find out the problem and redesign the app.</p>
			<h4>My Role</h4> 
			<p id="bullet">Worked alongside a team of designers and developers to come up with new designs, talk to users, test prototypes, discuss future projects, etc. Some highlights include:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Completely redesigned the mobile app.</li>
				<li>Designed a website for users to discover more users.</li>
				<li>Create desktop app to complement the mobile app.</li>
				<li>Implement Scrum to optimize the design process.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Step One: Discovery</h3>
			<h4>Survey</h4> 
			<p>Surveys were given to existing users to see what was good or bad about the app. After reading around 900 responses, we narrowed down the main problems. What the survey showed was that the UI was confusing, from a complicated onboarding process to a puzzling navigation.</p>
			<div class="dustimgs" id="shadow"><img class="surveyimg" src="dustsurvey.png"></div>
			<h4>User Test</h4>
			<p>Seeing firsthand how users interact with the app gave us insight to understand why users were having problems.  Major pain points include a confusing navigation, unclear terminology, ambiguous icons, an excess amount of unnecessary colors, and more.</p>
			<div class="dustimgs"><img class="img1" src="image1.png"></div>
			<h3>Step Two: Research</h3>
			
			<h4>Competitive Analysis</h4>
			<p>By researching similar apps, we could see what users needed or wanted the most. There weren't many apps similar to ours, and the existing ones were relatively new to the industry. We were still able to do enough research on these apps to find out what was and wasn't working.</p>
			<div class="dustimgs" id="shadow"><img class="companal" src="companalysis.png"></div>
			<h4>Prioritizing</h4>
			<p>With the overwhelming amount of changes needed to be made, we had to set our priorities straight. Too many minor pain points could just as easily cause users to turn away. Prioritizing helped us keep in the mind the smaller problems during the ongoing process.</p>
			<div class="dustimgs"><img class="img2" src="image2.png"></div>
			<h4>Wireframe</h4>
			<p>After we gathered enough data, we set out create a wireframe to help us plan better. We were able to complete a rough sketch of what was required, and not have to worry about adding new screens later. It helped us reduce the amount of unnecessary screens as well as dead-ends.</p>

			<h3>Step Three: Designing</h3>
			<h4>Navigation</h4>
			<p>The first major change was to create a central navigation. Users were confused with having to navigate with two bottom buttons and three top tabs. We tested various design iterations to find the one with the least pain points according to the users. In the end, a bottom navigation was the most effective. Condensing only the most important tabs to the navigation, users were able to navigate much more seamlessly.</p>

			<!--<p class="imgdescription">User testing different navigation styles.</p>-->
			<h4>Naming Convention</h4>
			<p>Another holdup was the amount of time users spent trying to understand what certain terms meant, terms such as "dust" and "blast." The icons we used didn't help as well, most of them were ambiguous. We tested many variations of words and icons only to discover that it was better to keep things simple. "Dust" changed to "Messages" and Blast became "Public." These small changes helped users navigate the app much easier.</p> 
			<div class="dustimgs"><img class="img4" src="image4.png"></div>
			<h4>Colors</h4>
			<p>Having multiple color schemes caused the app to look like a mess. Colors clashed all over the screen, resulting in users not knowing where to focus their attention or what items were clickable. By using one color, the app was able to reduce noise and distraction.</p>
			<div class="dustimgs"><img class="img6" src="image6.png"></div>
			<p>Our thought process was to figure out what emotions we wanted to convey when a user interacted with our app. To us, it was important to let users feel safe and secure when sending private messages. Blue was a great color to help reinforce those emotions. What we realized when testing with users was that blue was quickly associated with Facebook. People use Facebook to connect with friends and family publicly, so we decided it was best to not remind people of that. Our second best color was orange which also conveyed a sense of security. After testing with users, we saw that orange by comparison was an uncommon color, but also well received.</p>
			<div class="dustimgs"><img src="image7.png"></div>
			<h4>Prototyping & Testing</h4>
			<p>We created prototypes for each new feature, and was tested multiple times throughout the process. Getting feedback from users before finalizing designs was critical in our design process.</p>
			<div class="dustimgs" id="shadow"><img class="img6" src="dusttest.png"></div>
			<h3>Outcome</h3>
			<p>After many interations and test, the major pain points in the redesign were fixed and accounted for. Dust was a completely different looking app, starting from a new color scheme to new logo. </p>
			<div>
			<img class="imgstats" src="imgstats.png">
			</div>
			<p>Users responded positively to the newly refreshed app. Clicks generated from users grew <b class="bold">5x</b>, conversion rates increased <b class="bold">20%</b>, and user retention rose about <b class="bold">7x</b>. Engagement was at an all-time high, and drop-off rate with onboarding decreased. </p>

			<p id="last">There was still more to be done after fixing the larger problems. We had many smaller issues to take care. Efficiently using whitespace and different font weights to help define hierarchy. Creating informative empty state screens to stop users from getting stuck. Simplifying the onboarding process by reducing the amount of steps to helped reduce dropoff rate. Throughout the next couple months, we continued to test our designs with users to make sure each and every update was headache free. </p>
