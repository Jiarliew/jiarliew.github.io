			<h2>Redesigning Dust</h2>
			<p>After a couple years of constantly adding features, the app eventually became filled with all kinds of of features that didn't relate. The app felt cluttered with no correlation or visual hierarchy. As a result, users were getting confused and lost, ultimately leading to them leave the app for good. The task to completely redesign from the ground up was a challenge, but a much needed one. Throwing away old habits, the new app would be designed centered on our users.</p>
			<h2>Step One: Discovery</h2>
			<h4>Survey</h4> 
			<p>Surveys were sent out to users to ask what they liked and disliked about the app. After gathering and reading all the responses, results showed that the UI was a glaring problem. It was confusing all around, from the navigation down to the uncoordinated colors.</p>
			<h4>Initial User Testing</h4>
			<p>Viewing users interact with the app provided amazing insight to additional problems that we never would have gathered from surveys alone. The amount of problems in the end were astonishing, and we had a lot of work to do. Major pain points included a confusing navigation, unclear terminology, ambiguous icons, lack of hierarchy, and the list goes on. These issues caused our users to have a difficult time navigating the app.</p>
			<div class="dustimgs"><img class="img1" src="image1.png"></div>
			<!--<p class="imgdescription">Pain points discovered from user test and surveying.</p>-->
			<h4>Prioritizing</h4>
			<p>When creating a list of major pain points, small problems were also discovered. Even after the major problems were fixed, we knew that the amount of small problems could cause users to run away. Prioritizing pain points helped the design team to focus on the bigger issues while keeping the smaller problems in mind for later.</p>
			<div class="dustimgs"><img class="img2" src="image2.png"></div>
			<h4>Competitive Analysis</h4>
			<p>A great way to narrow down the important features was to create a competitive anaylsis. By comparing similar apps, we could focus on features that users needed the most.</p>
			<div class="dustimgs"><img class="companal" src="companalysis.png"></div>
			<!--<p class="imgdescription">Prioritizing pain points from high to low.</p>-->
			<h2>Step Two: Designing</h2>
			<h4>Navigation</h4>
			<p>The first major change was to create a central navigation. Users were confused with having to navigate with two bottom buttons and three top tabs. We tested various design iterations to find the one with the least pain points according to the users. In the end, a bottom navigation was the most effective. Condensing only the most important tabs to the navigation, users were able to navigate much more seamlessly.</p>

			<!--<p class="imgdescription">User testing different navigation styles.</p>-->
			<h4>Naming Convention</h4>
			<p>Although users were starting to understand our app a lot faster, there was still room for improvement. Users were still struggling to understand what certain tabs meant. The icons were too ambiguous with branded names we made up, names such as "dust" and "blast". This led to users having to tap around the navigation a couple more times than we liked. Creating conventional names and icons was the next problem to solve. We questioned users with various tab names to see what users would make of it. It was quickly discovered that the simpler terms were easier to understand.</p>
			<div class="dustimgs"><img class="img4" src="image4.png"></div>
			<!--<p class="imgdescription">Users had a hard time understanding where tabs lead to with the current naming conventions</p>-->
			<!--<div class="dustimgs"><img class="img5" src="image5.png"></div>-->
			<h4>Colors</h4>
			<p>Multiple colors schemes made the app inconsistent, leaving users to wonder what areas were tappable. Using one color scheme would help unify the app, while being able to put emphasis on important items that help guide the user. The apps main feature was to provide the user with a sense of trust and security. The color blue helped evoke both those emotions/feelings. We tested many different shades of blue, and other similar colors. After receiving feedback from our users, we realized that most of them instantly connected the app to Facebook.</p>
			<div class="dustimgs"><img class="img6" src="image6.png"></div>
			<!--<p class="imgdescription">The color blue conveys trust.</p>-->
			<p>Since we didn't want new users to associate our app with another, we decided to not use blue. This led to trying out other colors. Orange was another color that portrayed security, so we tested multiple shades of orange, and realized that it was a fantastic color to use. Orange was an uncommon color for apps, and users didn't associate that color to anything else.</p>
			<div class="dustimgs"><img class="img7" src="image7.png"></div>
			<!--<p class="imgdescription">Because blue was too associated with Facebook, orange was another color that conveyed a sense of security.</p>-->
			<p>We used the color orange very sparingly throughout the app. To help create a sense of hierarchy, we only colored what we wanted to emphasize that would help draw the users attention. A color palette was also created for future projects to keep from changing.</p>
			<!--<h4>Hierarchy</h4>
			<p>To keep things consistent at the moment and in the future, creating a color palette was needed so we wouldn't accidently use too many shades of orange. Another way we created hierarchy was to ke</p>-->
			<h2>Outcome</h2>
			<p>After knocking out the "larger" problems, there was still work to be done. Resolving minor issues still played a part in creating a user friendly app. Efficiently using whitepace and different font weights helped to create hierarchy in the app. Creating informative empty screens helped to redirect users around instead of getting stuck. Simplifying the onboarding process by making it quicker to sign up, generated more accounts created, and much less frustrated users.</p>

Every part of the app was completely overhauled, from the icons, to the colors, and even changing the name and logo. Without receiving input from our users, we never would have gotten this far.</p>
