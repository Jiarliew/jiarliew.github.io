			<h2>Problem</h2>
			<p>The task was to completely redesign the existing application. Instead of searching for design problems internally, feedback from current users gave insight to problems we wouldn't be able to find.</p>
			<h2>Step One: Discovery</h2>
			<h4>Survey</h4> 
			<p>Surveys were sent out to current users to ask what they liked and disliked about the app. After reading the responses, results showed that the UI was a glaring problem. It was confusing all around the app, from the navigation down to the color.</p>
			<h4>Initial User Testing</h4>
			<p>Viewing users interact with the app provided insight to additional problems they faced when using the app, from onboarding to changing settings.</p>
			<div class="dustimgs"><img class="img1" src="image1.png"></div>
			<p class="imgdescription">Pain points discovered from user test and surveying.</p>
			<p>Major pain points included a confusing navigation, unclear terminology, ambiguous icons, and lack of hierarchy. Because of all this, users had a hard time navigating the app in general. Which ultimately led to users being frustrated and leaving the app.</p>
			<h4>Prioritizing</h4>
			<p>When creating a list of major pain points, many small problems were also discovered from user testing. Prioritizing pain points helped the design team focus on the bigger issues when designing, while keeping the smaller problems in mind.</p>
			<div class="dustimgs"><img class="img2" src="image2.png"></div>
			<p class="imgdescription">Prioritizing pain points from high to low.</p>
			<h2>Step Two: Discovery</h2>
			<h4>Navigation</h4>
			<p>The first major change was to create a centralized navigation. Users were confused with the existing app that had two bottom buttons and three top tabs. We tested various design iterations to find the one with the least pain points according to the users.</p>
			<div class="dustimgs"><img class="img3" src="image3.png"></div>
			<p class="imgdescription">User testing different navigation styles.</p>
			<p>A bottom navigation deemed most effective. Creating a five tab navigation, with the important features, seemed to let users use the app with less confusion.</p>
			<h4>Naming Convention</h4>
			<p>Users were still struggling to understand what certain tabs did because of the branded terminology and the ambiguous icons that were used. This led to users having to tap around the navigation a couple times to fully understand. Creating more conventional text and icons was the next problem to solve.
			</p>
			<div class="dustimgs"><img class="img4" src="image4.png"></div>
			<p class="imgdescription">Users had a hard time understanding where tabs lead to with the current naming conventions</p>
			<p>The main tabs that were confusing to users were the "dust" and "blast" screen. The terminology was marketed with the app name in mind, but made no sense to new users. We questioned users with various tab names to see what users would make of it. It was quickly discovered that the simpler terms were easier to undertsand.</p>
			<!--<div class="dustimgs"><img class="img5" src="image5.png"></div>-->
			<h4>Color</h4>
			<p>Multiple colors made the app look inconsistent, and 
			also confused users at time for what was clickable. Using one color would help place emphasis on the important items that would help guide the user. The apps main feature was security, and users needed to trust using the app. Blue was the perfect color. After testing the various colors, almost all users associated the app to Facebook instantly.</p>
			<div class="dustimgs"><img class="img6" src="image6.png"></div>
			<p class="imgdescription">The color blue conveys trust.</p>
			<p>We didn't want new users to quickly associate our app with another, we decided to not use blue. This led to trying out other colors. Orange was another color that conveyed security, which was something the app needs users to believe.</p>
			<div class="dustimgs"><img class="img7" src="image7.png"></div>
			<p class="imgdescription">Because blue was too associated with Facebook, orange was another color that conveyed a sense of security.</p>
			<h2>Outcome</h2>
			<p>After knocking out the larger problems, there was still a lot of work to be done. Smaller issues still played a large part in creating a great app. Efficiently using whitepace and font weight helped to create hierarchy. Creating informative empty screens helped to guide users around the app. Simplifying the onboarding process generated more accounts created.</p>

			<p class="imgdescription">Before and after.</p>

			<p id="last">After many iterations and testing all over the app, the redesign was complete. There were many changes to the app, from onboarding, to icons, to colors, and even completely changing the name and logo. Without user testing, we never could've spotted or corrected many of the existing problems. Utilizing user test was a fantastic way to help improve our app.</p>
